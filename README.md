# Custom Shoelace CLI

The Custom Shoelace CLI provides an interactive way to integrate components from the Shoelace library into your project, customize the library name, and set component prefixes. It offers several features, including the ability to download specific versions of Shoelace, add new components, regenerate files, and configure auto-generated files for integration with tools such as VS Code or `.gitignore`.

## Features:

-   **Interactive CLI:** Engage with your configuration via an easy-to-use command-line interface.
-   **Shoelace Customization:** Set your library name, component prefix, vendor path, and target path.
-   **Component Management:** Choose specific Shoelace components to include in your project.
-   **Version Management:** Download specific versions of the Shoelace library.
-   **VS Code Integration:** Automatically update your VS Code settings to mark autogenerated files as readonly.
-   **Git Integration:** Easily add autogenerated files to your `.gitignore`.

## Configuration API:

The configuration file (`custom-shoelace.config.json`) keeps track of user-defined settings and choices. Here's what each key in the configuration file means:

-   **libraryName:** The name of your library (only lowercase letters allowed).
-   **libraryPrefix:** The prefix used for your components (only lowercase letters allowed).
-   **vendorPath:** The path where the Shoelace library is downloaded.
-   **targetPath:** The path where autogenerated files will be placed.
-   **shoelaceVersion:** The version of the Shoelace library you wish to use.
-   **components:** An array of Shoelace components you've chosen to integrate.
-   **lockFilesForVSCode:** A boolean to decide whether autogenerated files should be marked as readonly in VS Code.
-   **vscodePath:** Path to your VS Code's settings.json file.
-   **updateGitignore:** A boolean to decide whether autogenerated files should be added to `.gitignore`.
-   **gitignorePath:** Path to your project's `.gitignore` file.

## How to Use:

Simply run the CLI script and follow the on-screen prompts. The interactive nature of the CLI ensures you're guided through every step of the process.
